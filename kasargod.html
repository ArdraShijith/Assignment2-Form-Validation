                       <h6>Bekal fort</h6>
                       <p>Bekal is a small town on northern coast of Kerala where you will discover a giant keyhole-shaped fort (Citadel). History and legend are interwoven together in Bekal. The 300 year old Bekal Fort is largest and best-preserved citadel in Kerala which faces to the Arabian Sea.
                        This fort was constructed in 1650 CE. You can see the beauty of the Fort as well as the waves of the sea. The fort is well maintained with a wide beautiful garden. This imposing circular structure of laterite sites rises 130 feet above sea level and stands on a 35 acre headland that runs into the Arabian Sea. The fort walls are built to the edge of the beach. The Arabian Sea looks amazing from the view point.
                        This fort was built for fulfilling the defense requirements in medieval technology of defense strategy. So unlike most other Indian Forts, Bekal Fort was not a center of administration, and was not the part of any palace. The holes at the top are for targeting the enemy when they are far; the holes in the middle meant for hitting when the enemy is nearer and the holes underneath for attacking when the enemy is very near to the citadel.

        <h6>Chadragiri fort</h6>
        <p>Chandragiri fort is situated in Kasaragod district. This fort is bordered by the Chandragiri River. This fort was constructed in the 17th century and has a total area of 7 acres. The fort made of laterite stones is square shaped and is around 46 meters in length. The fort has two sides that face the sea with the watch tower facing the north direction. There are underground passages in the east and west directions. There are 8 view towers with holes in them for huge guns. The view of the river, sea and the sunset is extremely beautiful. One can take ride in a boat to the nearby islands and the palm groves. The history behind the Chandragiri fort is that the river was the border to two main kingdoms of the earlier period namely the Kolathunadu and Thulunadu. The Thulunadu was conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire and the Chandragiri region came under their control. When the Vijayanagara Empire declined, the conquered area was controlled by the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. In the 16th century with the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Shivappa Nayaka became the ruler of the independent Chandragiri. It was him who constructed the series of forts including Chandragiri. The forts were built mainly for defense purposes.</p>

   <h6>Kappil Beach</h6>
   <p>Beaches are about feeling one’s own heart beat frantically as a mighty being pulsates right in front of us. The ebbs and flows of our existence become one with sea, and that is why the few who make the trip to Kappil Beach, swear by it at all times. It is famous for its seclusion and rightly so. Large spaces of pristine sand and a divine water body in front with no other disturbance whatsoever is something people seek in growing numbers these days. Among the finest and cleanest beaches in God’s Own Country, this is a destination perfect for those who seek solitude and a place to face their own selves in peace.</p>

    <h6>Maipady</h6>
    <p>It is really not a “palace” in its true sense as some of our TripAdvisor members have pointed out. However, as it is the Royal residence of the descendants of the Hanagallu (hAnagallu) (ಹಾನಗಲ್ಲು) branch of the Kadamba dynasty, the inscriptions address it as the Palace, viz., ‘MAIPADY ARAMANE’ (MAIPADY PALACE).
      It is a palatial ‘traditional house’ and we learn that it is occupied by Sri Dhana-Marthanda Varma Raja alias Ramantharasugalu - XIII, the son-in-law of Shri Shri Thrinetra Mayura Varama Rajapeeta. According to Wikipedia, Maipady Venkatesh Varma Raja (Ramantharasugal – XI), popularly known as the Raja of Maipady was the last Monarch of the Principality of Maipady Seeme, which roughly comprised of the area of the present Kasaragod taluk of Kasaragod district, Kerala, India and some neighbouring regions. To the right side of the palace is a small temple and what we see from the gate is the backside of the temple with a big well.
      Thanks to the one descendent Royal lady, who explained to us about the palace and took us around. According to her, the modern Yellow painted ‘Maipady Palace” that we see first, before the Main Palace (with spacious estate-like garden containing plantain, arcanut and coconut trees) is the one that belongs to the brother of Sri Dhana-Marthanda Varma Raja. Navarathri Pooja seems to be celebrated in a grand manner.</p>
