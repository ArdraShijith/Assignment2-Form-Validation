                       <p>A natural cascading waterfall, the Adyanpara is counted amongst the best of Malappuram tourist places. Located in in the Kurmbalangodu village of Nilambur district near Malappuram, the waterfalls are a seasonal delight. 

                       In summers, the water runs dry and with a lesser flow, but are nonetheless similarly beautiful to look at. The waters of the falls descend down in a cascade over the rocks of the hill, with a rich variety of flora around it to make it look even more mesmerizing.

   <h6>Thirunavaya Nava Mukunda Temple</h6>
   <p>An ancient Hindu temple built on the North bank of the Bharatapuzzha River, this place of worship is dedicated to Navamukundan or the Narayana Vishnu, and is one of the 108 â€˜Tirupatis in the country. The most majestic part of the rituals here includes the usage of the water from the River, same as in the fashion followed in Kashi. 

    What is noteworthy is that the structure standing today is not the same as the original one, as it was destroyed twice in 18th century and 20th century, and somehow still retains the original charm.</p>
