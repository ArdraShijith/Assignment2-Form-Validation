                       <h6>Edakkal Caves</h6>
                       <p>Edakkal Caves are two natural caves at a remote location at Edakkal, 25 km (15.5 mi) from Kalpetta in the Wayanad district of Kerala in India's Western Ghats. They lie 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, near an ancient trade route connecting the high mountains of Mysore to the ports of the Malabar coast. Inside the caves are pictorial writings believed to date to at least 6,000 BCE,from the Neolithic man, indicating the presence of a prehistoric civilization or settlement in this region. The Stone Age carvings of Edakkal are rare and are the only known examples from South India.The caves contain drawings that range over periods from the Neolithic as early as 6,000 BC to 1,000 BCE. The youngest group of paintings have been in the news for a possible connection to the Indus Valley Civilization.

                        Historian Raghava Varier of the Kerala State Archaeology Department identified a depiction as "a man with jar cup" that is the most distinct motif of the Indus valley civilization. The finding, made in September 2009, indicates that the Harappan civilization was active in the region. The "a man with jar cup" symbol from Edakkal seems to be more similar to the Indus motif than those already known from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Mr. Varier said "The discovery of the symbols are akin to that of the Harappan civilization having predominantly Dravidian culture and testimony to the fact that cultural diffusion could take place. It is wrong to presume that the Indus culture disappeared into thin air." Iravatham Mahadevan, a scholar of Indus valley and gehsusue scripts said the findings were very significant called it a "major discovery".</p>

        <h6>Banasura Sagar Dam</h6>
        <p>Banasura Sagar Dam, which impounds the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabini River, is part of the Indian Banasurasagar Project consisting of a dam and a canal project started in 1979.The goal of the project is to support the Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and satisfy the demand for irrigation and drinking water in a region known to have water shortages in seasonal dry periods.

          In the dam's reservoir there is a set of islands that were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas. The islands with the Banasura hills are in the background view. It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.</p>

   <h6>Jain Temple at Sulthan Bathery</h6>
   <p>At a distance of 24 km from Kalpetta & 1 km from Sulthan Bathery Bus Station, Jain Temple is an ancient temple located in the heart of Sulthan Bathery town in Wayanad district. This is one of the most important amongst a series of ruins spread across Kerala that testify to a period of a strong Jain presence in this region and also one of the best heritage places to visit in Wayanad.

    The Jain Temple at Sultan Bathery is believed to have been built in 13th century AD. The temple has an interesting history. It first served as a shrine, and then became an important center of commercial activity. Later in 18th century, it became a dumping ground of ammunitions by Tipu Sultan.
    
    The town of Sulthan Bathery was earlier known as Ganapathi Vattam and had 12 traditional Jain streets in and around the town. After Tipu's vandalism, the temple was deserted for about 150 years. Later the Archaeological Survey of India took over the maintenance and declared it a monument of national importance. The courtyard is well laid with lawns and ornamental plants now.
    
    The architecture of the temple has strong influences of the then Vijayanagar architectural style. It was built with large granite pillars that are extensively carved. The temple is mostly plain from outside with few nice carvings in the inner section. There is a detached pillared mandapa on the front side of the temple without roof which is known as Namaskara mandapa. The main structure has a mukhamandapa followed by mahamandapa and the sanctum.
    
    The sanctum has few small statues of Jain Tirthankaras, but the main seat of the sanctum is empty and no poojas are performed here. The doorways of sanctum and mahamandapa have sacred Jain figures. The lower portion of the doorway has beautiful floral motifs. The pillars have various designs such as sarpabandha, floral designs, Thirthankara, Goose, etc. The main deity's idol is currently in the Ananthanath Temple at Kalpetta. Once a year during Mahavir Jayanthi, the idol is brought here. The temple festival falls on that day. The temple is open to the Jains for worship during the festival.</p>

    <h6>Pazhassi Raja's Tomb</h6>
    <p>The Pazhassi Tomb is where thousands regularly pay homage to the famous Lion of Kerala, Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. The tomb was constructed in the place where his body was cremated, and is situated on the banks of River Kabani in Mananthavady.

      In 1996 March this tomb has been converted to museum and today the museum is one of the centres in the State which attracts historians, researchers and students from far and wide.
      
      The museum also contains Pazhassi Raja's sword and other information about the cultural history of Kerala. The memorial is managed by the Kerala State Archaeology Department.
      
      Pazhassi Raja, a fierce King, is among the few leaders in the Indian sub-continent to ever score a military victory over the British. He is remembered for his love and undying loyalty towards his subjects till the very end. The Pulpally Cave was where Pazhassi took refuge until he was captured by the British.</p>
